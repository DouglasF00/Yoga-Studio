        <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
        <p>We believe in the indiivuals ability to remain and rediscover it's own, true potential and strength. Well thought trough yoga classes will create flexibility and movement no matter age or background. To create a flow with recognition, the yoga positions and sequences can become meditation within movement.</p>
        <p>We want to spread knowledge between the body and mind which leads to a healthy performance and practice as well as break out of bad habits and patterns and change out perspective. We encourage to be brave and playful during your practice to develop and live your full potential. Let your personality, creativity, inspiration, fantasy and humour shine through!</p>
        <p>Yoga is for your body and mind and we think highly of the benefits of our practice. In today's society, it's more needed than ever to have a safe place where you can gather your thoughts and feelings and get an outlet for them. By adding your breathwork and to use your body and mind as one, we're proud to contribute to a less stressed society and to decrease the risk of mental illness and other stress related consequences.</p>
